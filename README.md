# Would You Rather
This is the final project in the React Nanodegree course I took with Udacity.  

In this project I utilized React and Redux to build a web app that allows a user to play a "Would Your Rather" game.

Would you rather is a fun game where the user has to chose between two scenarios.

Once the user has answered the question, they can see the polling results.

The app allows the user to
   * View a list of unanswered questions
   * View a list of answered questions
   * Create new questions
   * Answer questions 
   * See how others have answered the poll
   * See user rankings on the leaderboard

## Getting Started
